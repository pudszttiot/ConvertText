Usage
--------
  Just type in the text input field and press the "Convert" button to use ConvertText. 

  Explore all the options below:

  Uppercase:
  The Uppercase text converter can be used to convert text from its original format to uppercase letters only. This means   that any lowercase letters in the original text will be transformed into their uppercase equivalents.

  For example, if you had the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," the uppercase text converter would   change it to "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG."


  Title Case:
  The Title Case text converter can be used to convert text into a specific capitalization format where the first letter of         each word is capitalized, except for certain words that are not capitalized. This format is commonly used for titles of       books, articles, and other written works.

  For example, if you had the text "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the Title Case text converter would       change it to "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog".


  Random Case:
  The Random Case text converter can be used to convert text randomly, meaning that it changes the capitalization of         letters in a way that is not predictable or consistent.

  For example, if you had the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" the Random Case text converter might     change it to "thE QUICK broWn fOx jumPs OVER thE lazY DOG".
  As you can see, the capitalization of letters is different in each word, and there is no particular pattern to the changes.


  Reverse Text:
  The Reverse Text converter can be used to reverse the order of the characters in a given text string. This means that   the last character becomes the first, the second-to-last character becomes the second, and so on until the first   character becomes the last.

  For example, if you had the text "hello" the Reverse Text converter would change it to "olleh".
  The tool simply takes the input text and iterates over each character, starting from the end and working backwards, to   construct a new string with the characters in reverse order.


  Backwards Text:
  The Backwards Text converter can be used to take a string of text and rearranges its characters in reverse order, so that   the last character becomes the first and the first character becomes the last.

  For example, if you had the text "hello for example" the Backwards Text converter would 
  change it to "example for hello".
  The process of reversing a text can be done manually by writing the characters in reverse order, but it can be tedious   and time-consuming, especially for longer texts. Therefore, a Backwards Text converter automates the process by   taking the input text and applying an algorithm that reverses its characters, making the task quick and easy.


  Phonetic Alphabet:
  The Phonetic Alphabet converter can be used to convert words or phrases from their standard written form into a     phonetic alphabet. Phonetic alphabets are systems of symbols that represent the sounds of speech making it easier to   communicate spoken information over the phone, radio, or in noisy environments.

  For example, if you had the text "hello for example" the Phonetic Alphabet converter would change it to "Hotel Echo   Lima Lima Oscar   Foxtrot Oscar Romeo   Echo Xray Alpha Mike Papa Lima Echo".


  1337 (Leet Speak):
  The 1337 (Leet Speak) converter can be used to convert ordinary text into a modified form of writing that uses a   combination of alphanumeric characters, symbols, and other typographical features to represent words. Leet Speak   originated as a way for early computer users and hackers to communicate online without being detected by automated   filters or censors. In Leet Speak, certain letters are replaced with numbers or other characters that resemble them,   such as "4" for "a", "3" for "e", "1" for "l", "0" for "o", and so on. Other characters, such as "@" for "a" and "$" for "s"      are also commonly used.

  For example, if you had the text "elite" the Phonetic Alphabet converter would change it to "3l173".
     [or]
  For example, if you had the text "hello for example" the Phonetic Alphabet converter would change 
  it to "h3110 f0r 3x4mp13".
